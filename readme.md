## Quick Guide
<div><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1049837871772729354.gif?size=20&quality=lossless" alt="Alert"/>&nbsp;<b> This guide only includes the most relevant info and might not be enough to run WeMod,</b>
<div> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if so check out the <a href="https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher/wiki/Full-Guide">Full Guide</a> <b>OR</b> the <a href="https://youtu.be/5UlVCZvIl1E">video tutorial by Marvin1099</a><br><br>

- **Optional:** If you have access to another PC and wish to control the Steam Deck remotely,  
consider using **[RustDesk](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/latest)** for easier setup (the `.flatpak` is easiest).

- **Important:** There is currently a Proposal to change the Lisence of the wemod launcher from MIT to AGLP.
  Please vote with your opinion right here: (Proposal to Change License from MIT to AGPL #131)[https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher/discussions/131].

1. First `Python venv` and `TK` need to be installed  
   TK / Tkinter may have a other name in your repos  
   Search the internet for `install Tkinter for YOURDISTRO` (eg. Ubuntu)
2. Also Search for and install `ProtonUp-QT` in the store.
3. Download the latest `GE-Proton` in `ProtonUp-QT`  
   **NOTE:** After some testing it seams `Proton` also works  
   So you can try to run the launcher with `Proton` and without `GE-Proton`
4. Restart Steam/SteamOS
5. Run `git clone https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher.git` in the Konsole/Terminal
6. Run `sudo chmod -R ug+x /home/$USER/wemod-launcher` in the Konsole/Terminal  
   **NOTE:** For use with the Steam Flatpak (not recomended) contiune [here](https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher/wiki/Steam-Flatpak-Usage)
7. In the WeMod chosen game, open the steam game settings  
   and in the `Compatibility` tab change the proton version to the downloaded one.
8. Also add the command `/home/$USER/wemod-launcher/wemod %command%`,  
   in the steam game settings under `Launch Options`
9. Start the game
10. Select no to the copy prefix question if it says it `might work`  
   If it says it `likely works` go to 12.
11. Select download
12. Select Yes/Ok until no more windows appear  
    All rundll32.exe errors can safely be ignored (click on `no` here)
13. WeMod will start with the game
14. Login and click play in WeMod for chosen game   
15. Set Mods and Switch to game or close the WeMod window,  
    it will keep running in the background

The wemod-launcher will automatically update if you installed it using step 5.  
**But:** This will only work if you have [launcher version 1.092 or older](https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher/wiki/The-Self-Update).

**Optionally:** Check out tutorials on how to use specific [WeMod Laucher features](https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher/wiki/Launcher-Tutorials)  
**Like:** Check how to [Use External Launchers](https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher/wiki/Using-External-Launchers) (Use The WeMod Launcher outside of Steam)  
**OR:** Check out how to [Edit The Config](https://github.com/DaniAsh551/wemod-launcher/wiki/Config-Usage)
