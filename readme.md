## DISCLAIMER
This project is *NOT* affiliated with, funded by, or paid by WeMod.  
The work done here is purely from the contributors who donate their time and effort.

## Potential Rework
Weâ€™re considering a **complete rework** of the WeMod Launcher to improve performance, compatibility, and user experience.  

This possible project would need:  
- **Developers**: Mainly python developers for Struture, GUI, Wine, config management, and more.  
- **Wiki writers**: To create and maintain documentation for the rework.  
- **Community testers**: To test features and provide valuable feedback.

## Quick Guide
![Alert](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1049837871772729354.gif?size=20&quality=lossless) **This guide only includes the most relevant info and might not be enough to run WeMod;**  
in which case, check out the [Full Guide](https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher/wiki/Full-Guide) **OR** the [video tutorial by Marvin1099](https://youtu.be/5UlVCZvIl1E).

- **Optional:** If you have access to another PC and wish to control the Steam Deck remotely,  
consider using **[RustDesk](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/latest)** for easier setup (the `.flatpak` is easiest).

- **Info:** The Proposal to change the License of the wemod launcher from MIT to AGLP3  
  was accepted by contributions and voters [(info here)](https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher/discussions/131) 
  and was integrated into the project on 1st December 2024.

1. Python `virtualenv` (or `venv`) and `Tk` need to be installed.  
	`venv` should already be integrated in your `python3` installation.
	Tk / Tkinter may be under a different name in your distribution's repos.  
	If none of the below options work (or your distro is missing), search on the internet for `install Tkinter for YOURDISTRO`.
	- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3-tk`
	- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S tk`.
	- Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`
2. Install GE-Proton, which is necessary to run the game and WeMod with. Using Valve's own Proton seems to work, but using GE-Proton is recommended:  
	1. Search for and install `ProtonUp-QT` via your distro's software center. If using Flatpak, command is: `flatpak install net.davidotek.pupgui2`.
	2. Download the latest GE-Proton in `ProtonUp-QT`  
3. Restart Steam/SteamOS.
4. In a terminal session (Konsole if using KDE Plasma):
	1. Change directory to a location of your choosing, then run `git clone https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher`.  
	Make note of the directory obtained with `readlink -f wemod-launcher` (which will be labeled `{path/to/wemod-launcher}` for the rest of this guide).
	2. Run `chmod -R ug+x wemod-launcher`.  
	**NOTE:** To use this tool with the Flatpak version of Steam (not recomended), continue [here](https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher/wiki/Steam-Flatpak-Usage).
5. In your Steam Library, open the game settings with which to run WeMod with. Make sure you ran the game once before doing this!
	1. In the `Compatibility` tab, change the Proton version to the one picked in Step 2, or otherwise to the latest numbered Proton (e.g. Proton-9.0).
	2. Under `Launch Options`, input `{path/to/wemod-launcher}/wemod %command%`.
6. Start the game.
7. Select "no" to the "copy prefix question" if it appears and says `might work`.  
   If it mentions `likely works` (or better) go to step 9 (accept all).
8. Select download.
9. Select Yes/Ok until no more windows appear.  
    All rundll32.exe errors can safely be ignored (by clicking `no`).  
	WeMod should start with the game.
10. (Only done once): Login to your WeMod account.
11. Select the game you're running from the library, then click the Play to start the WeMod engine.   
12. You may now set or switch mods. Closing the WeMod window will keep it running in the background.

wemod-launcher will automatically update if you installed it using step 5.  
**But**: This will only work if you have [launcher version 1.092 or older](https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher/wiki/The-Self-Update).

**Optionally**: Check out tutorials on how to use specific [WeMod Laucher features](https://github.com/DeckCheatz/wemod-launcher/wiki/Launcher-Tutorials)
